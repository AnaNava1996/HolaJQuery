# HolaJQuery

Is a mini project where I used jQuery for my first time, in which you can change the style of the page just pressing the buttoms. Also, in the third style, you can write a colour in hex and watch how it looks(it was just to use silly servlets because those where obligatory for the project >:c even if servlets are almost obsolete)
